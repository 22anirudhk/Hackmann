# Kommunity
Kommunity is a platform for social good. It allows individuals to volunteer to fulfill a request for help from someone nearby. This could range from picking up groceries to carrying furniture and gardening.

Find it on https://kommunity.vercel.app/

## Note
- There are two branches. The master (and up to date) branch is hosted on Vercel (and backend on MongoDB Atlas). 
- This project was originally a hackathon submission(https://devpost.com/software/kommunity-9zwgya), which used Google Cloud Platform to host both the backend and MongoDB database. You can check out the code for that on the Google Cloud Branch. Just a reminder that the GCP server is not running now, so you won't be able to use the GCP version of the application. 

## What's Next?
- Fix user interface to fit more devices, have profile pictures, make it more responsive, look better in general.
- Possibly implement Google OAuth.
- Use React.JS for the cards instead of regular JS.
- Suggest suggested volunteer opportunities by location and date.
- Remove accepted tasks from database.
